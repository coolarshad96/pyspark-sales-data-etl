            2. Clean Data: Remove null values, filter invalid records, and standardize columns.
            3. Transformations: Calculate metrics like total sales per region, product category, and monthly trends.
            4. Store Data: Write the output to a Parquet file or a data warehouse (e.g., Amazon S3, Google BigQuery).
